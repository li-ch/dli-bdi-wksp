# NVIDIA-BDI Joint Deep Learning Workshop

NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute in partnership with HKUST Big Data Institute are excited to announce this 1-day practical deep learning workshop in HKUST on 24 July, 2017.

Deep learning is a hot topic in both academia and industry since it has recently dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in areas such as speech recognition, computer vision, predicting the activity of drug molecules, and many other machine learning tasks. The basic idea in deep learning is to automatically learn to represent data in multiple layers of increasing abstraction, thus helping to discover intricate structure in large datasets.

The 1-day workshop will provide excellent opportunity to learn fundamentals of deep learning, starting from basic workflows in deep learning, as well as how to use TensorFlow for building intelligent applications.

## Hands-on Experience with TensorFlow

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain Team within Google's Machine Intelligence research organization. The system is designed to facilitate research in machine learning, and to make it quick and easy to transition from research prototype to production system.

TensorFlow's flexible architecture allows you to deploy computation on everything from multiple CPUs or GPUs to a mobile device with a single APIâ€™. Scalability and flexibility of TensorFlow is one of the main advantages it holds over competing frameworks.

Participants in both workshop labs will be given certificate of completion. Enroll now to learn everything you need to design, train, and integrate neural network-powered artificial intelligence into your applications using TensorFlow.
